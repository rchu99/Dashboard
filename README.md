## Dashboard

Dashboard created using Angular
 
## Development

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1. [Node.js][]: I use Node.js to run a development web server and build the project.
   Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.
2. [Firebase][]: I use a test database with keys from Firebase. I recommend you use your own to become familiar with it.

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.
You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [package.json](package.json).

    npm install
    npm start
    
To run the project type:

    ng serve --open
